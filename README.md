# hello-world

Hi! I'm Isa and I am a sophomore at the University of Southern California majoring in Cognitive Science with a minor in Behavioral Economics.
This is my first experience using Github! 
I am using this platform as a part of my week 3 project for my internship with Upkey.
This week we are focusing on Entrepreneurship and Strategy.
